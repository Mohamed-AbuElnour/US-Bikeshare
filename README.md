# US-Bikeshare
## Overview:
This project is part of applied skills in the Data Analysis Professional Track Nanodegree offered by Udacity and ITIDA under the "Egypt fwd initiative".
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Output:
I managed to deliver a Python file where the company's management can enjoy an interactive experience to view the data at their own pace, with multiple filtration options. My analysis of the data answered many questions that can give insights to the management to make profit-pulling decisions. Such questions are:
-	To increase demand for bike-sharing services, what age group is best to be targeted?
-	What is the rush hour of using bikes so that the company can increase its available stock of bikes during it and preserve customer satisfaction?
-	What are the most popular, start station, end station, and trip for customers?
